    "# TASK 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW - MAKING TOOLS FOR MODELS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! We've built chatbots, tutors, image processors, and even multi-agent systems. Now, let's explore how to make these creations available as **standardized tools** that other AI models or applications can easily use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** How does an AI model (like a large language model) reliably use external functions or APIs? Traditionally, this required custom integrations (\"plugins\") for each specific tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Model-Context-Protocol (MCP)**\n",
    "MCP is an open specification designed to be a **standard way for models to discover and interact with tools**. Imagine a universal plug adapter for AI tools! A model can ask an MCP-enabled service:\n",
    "1.  \"What tools do you offer?\" (by fetching a standard description called a **manifest**)\n",
    "2.  \"Okay, please use tool X with these inputs.\" (by calling a standard **action** endpoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradio makes it incredibly easy to expose *your* Python functions as MCP tools.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this module, we will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand MCP:** Learn the core concepts of the Model-Context-Protocol.\n",
    "2.  **Expose Existing Work:** Turn our \"Advanced AI Tutor\" into an MCP tool using Gradio (`mcp=True`).\n",
    "3.  **Create a New Tool:** Build and expose a new \"Image Style Analyzer\" tool via MCP using Gradio.\n",
    "4.  **Run MCP Servers:** Learn how to run these Gradio apps so they serve MCP endpoints.\n",
    "5.  **Act as an MCP Client:** Write Python code in *this notebook* to:\n",
    "    *   Discover the capabilities (manifest) of our running tools.\n",
    "    *   Execute the tools (call actions) remotely via HTTP requests.\n",
    "6.  **Simulate Tool Use:** Create a simple \"AI Assistant\" simulation in the notebook that decides when to call these external MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Goal:** Understand MCP by building two Gradio MCP servers (AI Tutor, Image Style Analyzer) and interacting with them programmatically from a Jupyter notebook, simulating how an AI could leverage these external tools."

    "# TASK 2: UNDERSTANDING MCP (MODEL-CONTEXT-PROTOCOL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we code, let's clarify MCP. It standardizes how a **Model** (like an LLM) interacts with **Context** (external tools, APIs, functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **MCP Server:** An application (like our Gradio app) that exposes one or more tools via MCP. It listens for requests on specific HTTP endpoints.\n",
    "2.  **Manifest (`/mcp/manifest.json`):** A standard JSON file served by the MCP server. It describes the available tools (called \"actions\" in MCP terms):\n",
    "    *   What each tool is called (`name`).\n",
    "    *   What it does (`description`).\n",
    "    *   What inputs it needs (`parameters`).\n",
    "    *   What output it provides.\n",
    "    *   Models use this manifest to **discover** tools and understand how to use them.\n",
    "3.  **Action Endpoint (`/mcp/action`):** A standard endpoint on the MCP server where the model sends a request (usually a POST request) to *execute* a specific tool/action. The request includes the action name and the required parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Standardization:** Models don't need custom code for every tool. If a tool speaks MCP, the model knows how to talk to it.\n",
    "*   **Discoverability:** Models can dynamically find out what tools are available in their environment.\n",
    "*   **Decoupling:** Tools can be developed and updated independently from the models that use them.\n",
    "*   **Gradio Integration:** Gradio makes *serving* MCP incredibly simple – often just one parameter (`mcp=True`)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our Gradio apps will be the **MCP Servers**, and this notebook will act as the **MCP Client** (simulating a model wanting to use the tools).\n"
