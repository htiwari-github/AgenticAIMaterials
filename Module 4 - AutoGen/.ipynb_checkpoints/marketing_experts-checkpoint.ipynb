    "# TASK 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW - FROM AGENTS TO INTERACTIVE TEAMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! We've explored direct interactions with LLMs and built UIs with Gradio. Now, we delve into a more advanced concept: creating **teams of AI Agents** that can collaborate, and even interact with *you*, using the **Autogen** framework and **Gradio**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Big Idea:**\n",
    "Imagine AI assistants that don't just answer your questions but can take on roles (like a Marketing Manager or a Creative Writer), communicate with each other, and work towards a common goal. **What if these assistants could even use different AI 'brains' (like GPT for one and Gemini for another) within the same team?** This is the flexibility we'll explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autogen** is a powerful library that makes building these multi-agent systems much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this module, we will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Demystify AI Agents:** Understand the basic concept.\n",
    "2.  **Set Up Autogen & Keys:** Configure Autogen and load API keys for *both* OpenAI and Google.\n",
    "3.  **Create Agents (Single Model):** Build a Marketing CMO and Brand Marketer using OpenAI's GPT first.\n",
    "4.  **Observe Basic Collaboration:** Make the agents discuss ideas using Autogen's chat capabilities (`initiate_chat`, `max_turns`).\n",
    "5.  **Introduce Multi-Model Power:** Modify agents to use *different* LLMs (e.g., Gemini for CMO, GPT for Marketer).\n",
    "6.  **See the Mixed Team Work:** Run the chat again with the multi-model setup.\n",
    "7.  **Introduce Human Oversight:** Add a \"User Proxy\" agent for your input.\n",
    "8.  **Build an Interactive UI:** Use Gradio to create a chat interface for your multi-model AI team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Goal:** An interactive Gradio web app where you can give instructions to a simulated marketing team (a Gemini-powered CMO & a GPT-powered Brand Marketer) and see them collaborate.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. **Behind-the-Scenes Footprints:**\n",
      "   - **Concept:** Short videos that take viewers through the sustainable materials sourcing and shoe production process. Use quick cuts to showcase the eco-friendly factories, material transformations, and craftsmanship.\n",
      "   - **Visuals:** High-energy visuals with fast-paced editing, featuring artisans at work, raw materials, and the final product. Overlay text highlighting key sustainability facts (e.g., \"Made from 100% recycled materials\").\n",
      "   - **Call to Action (CTA):** Encourage viewers to share their own sustainable practices using a dedicated hashtag (e.g., #MyFootprint).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Footprints in Nature:**\n",
      "   - **Concept:** Capture influencers and everyday customers wearing the shoes in beautiful natural settings, emphasizing their commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness.\n",
      "   - **Visuals:** Scenic shots of individuals walking in forests, parks, or beaches, leaving \"positive footprints\" (e.g., flower petals or green leaves) behind them. Use slow-motion effects to enhance the visual impact.\n",
      "   - **CTA:** Prompt viewers to tag locations where they make a positive impact on the environment while wearing the shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sustainable Style Challenge:**\n",
      "   - **Concept:** Start a challenge where participants create outfits incorporating the shoes, focusing on sustainable fashion. Influencers kick off the challenge, showcasing their look and encouraging followers to join.\n",
      "   - **Visuals:** Quick outfit transitions featuring the shoes styled in different ways, with fun music and playful text overlays that educate on sustainable fashion tips.\n",
      "   - **CTA:** Use a campaign-specific hashtag (e.g., #ReimagineMyFootprint) and offer a prize for the best outfit, such as a gift card or a free pair of shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impactful Footprints:**\n",
      "   - **Concept:** Create videos that illustrate the positive impact of purchasing the shoes, such as carbon offset statistics or the number of trees planted for each pair sold. Use graphics to visualize the data.\n",
      "   - **Visuals:** Use animated infographics interspersed with clips of the shoes in action. Include testimonials from environmental activists discussing the importance of sustainable consumerism.\n",
      "   - **CTA:** Encourage viewers to visit the website for more information on their impact and to make a purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **User-Generated Footprints:**\n",
      "   - **Concept:** Encourage customers to share their own videos of how they're reimagining their footprint while wearing the shoes. Highlight stories of personal sustainability journeys.\n",
      "   - **Visuals:** Curate a series of clips featuring diverse customers engaging in eco-friendly activities, such as planting trees, cleaning beaches, or biking to work.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Schedule a Meeting:**\n",
      "   - Set up a meeting with the product development and supply chain teams to discuss the following agenda items:\n",
      "     - Current sourcing practices and materials used in the new sustainable shoe line.\n",
      "     - Verification processes for ethical sourcing and labor practices.\n",
      "     - Strategies for ensuring full transparency in the supply chain, including certifications (e.g., Fair Trade, Global Organic Textile Standard).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Establish Supply Chain Standards:**\n",
      "   - Develop a clear set of guidelines for sourcing and manufacturing that align with our sustainability goals. This could include:\n",
      "     - Prioritizing suppliers who use renewable energy.\n",
      "     - Ensuring all materials are sourced from sustainable practices (e.g., recycled, organic, biodegradable).\n",
      "     - Implementing regular audits or assessments for compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create a Transparency Report:**\n",
      "   - Initiate the creation of a transparency report that outlines our sourcing practices, environmental impact, and labor standards. This report can be used in marketing materials and shared with partners like 1% for the Planet to reinforce our commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Engage with Stakeholders:**\n",
      "   - Organize workshops or meetings with stakeholders in the supply chain to discuss best practices and innovations in sustainable materials and manufacturing processes. This will foster collaboration and ensure all parties are aligned with our sustainability mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prepare for Marketing Integration:**\n",
      "   - Once product integrity and supply chain transparency are firmly established, plan how to communicate these values in the \"Reimagine Footprints\" campaign. This could involve:\n",
      "     - Behind-the-scenes videos showcasing the sourcing and manufacturing process.\n",
      "     - Infographics that detail the environmental benefits of our materials and practices.\n",
      "     - Customer engagement initiatives that invite them to learn more about our supply chain and participate in sustainability discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Actions\n",
      "- After the meeting, compile notes and action items.\n",
      "- Assign responsibilities to team members for each of the action items and set deadlines for completion.\n",
      "- Regularly review progress on supply chain initiatives and their integration into marketing strategies.\n",

       "   - **Call to Action (CTA):** Encourage viewers to share their own sustainable practices using a dedicated hashtag (e.g., #MyFootprint).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Footprints in Nature:**\n",
       "   - **Concept:** Capture influencers and everyday customers wearing the shoes in beautiful natural settings, emphasizing their commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness.\n",
       "   - **Visuals:** Scenic shots of individuals walking in forests, parks, or beaches, leaving \"positive footprints\" (e.g., flower petals or green leaves) behind them. Use slow-motion effects to enhance the visual impact.\n",

       "   - **Concept:** Start a challenge where participants create outfits incorporating the shoes, focusing on sustainable fashion. Influencers kick off the challenge, showcasing their look and encouraging followers to join.\n",
       "   - **Visuals:** Quick outfit transitions featuring the shoes styled in different ways, with fun music and playful text overlays that educate on sustainable fashion tips.\n",
       "   - **CTA:** Use a campaign-specific hashtag (e.g., #ReimagineMyFootprint) and offer a prize for the best outfit, such as a gift card or a free pair of shoes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Impactful Footprints:**\n",
       "   - **Concept:** Create videos that illustrate the positive impact of purchasing the shoes, such as carbon offset statistics or the number of trees planted for each pair sold. Use graphics to visualize the data.\n",
       "   - **Visuals:** Use animated infographics interspersed with clips of the shoes in action. Include testimonials from environmental activists discussing the importance of sustainable consumerism.\n",
       "   - **CTA:** Encourage viewers to visit the website for more information on their impact and to make a purchase.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **User-Generated Footprints:**\n",
       "   - **Concept:** Encourage customers to share their own videos of how they're reimagining their footprint while wearing the shoes. Highlight stories of personal sustainability journeys.\n",
       "   - **Visuals:** Curate a series of clips featuring diverse customers engaging in eco-friendly activities, such as planting trees, cleaning beaches, or biking to work.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Schedule a Meeting:**\n",
       "   - Set up a meeting with the product development and supply chain teams to discuss the following agenda items:\n",
       "     - Current sourcing practices and materials used in the new sustainable shoe line.\n",
       "     - Verification processes for ethical sourcing and labor practices.\n",
       "     - Strategies for ensuring full transparency in the supply chain, including certifications (e.g., Fair Trade, Global Organic Textile Standard).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Establish Supply Chain Standards:**\n",
       "   - Develop a clear set of guidelines for sourcing and manufacturing that align with our sustainability goals. This could include:\n",
       "     - Prioritizing suppliers who use renewable energy.\n",
       "     - Ensuring all materials are sourced from sustainable practices (e.g., recycled, organic, biodegradable).\n",
       "     - Implementing regular audits or assessments for compliance.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Create a Transparency Report:**\n",
       "   - Initiate the creation of a transparency report that outlines our sourcing practices, environmental impact, and labor standards. This report can be used in marketing materials and shared with partners like 1% for the Planet to reinforce our commitment.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Engage with Stakeholders:**\n",
       "   - Organize workshops or meetings with stakeholders in the supply chain to discuss best practices and innovations in sustainable materials and manufacturing processes. This will foster collaboration and ensure all parties are aligned with our sustainability mission.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Prepare for Marketing Integration:**\n",
       "   - Once product integrity and supply chain transparency are firmly established, plan how to communicate these values in the \"Reimagine Footprints\" campaign. This could involve:\n",
       "     - Behind-the-scenes videos showcasing the sourcing and manufacturing process.\n",
       "     - Infographics that detail the environmental benefits of our materials and practices.\n",
       "     - Customer engagement initiatives that invite them to learn more about our supply chain and participate in sustainability discussions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Follow-Up Actions\n",
       "- After the meeting, compile notes and action items.\n",
       "- Assign responsibilities to team members for each of the action items and set deadlines for completion.\n",
       "- Regularly review progress on supply chain initiatives and their integration into marketing strategies.\n",
       "\n",
       "By ensuring that our product lives up to the marketing promises, we can build trust with our consumers and strengthen the overall effectiveness of the \"Reimagine Footprints\" campaign."

      "Okay, I love the creativity and focus on community engagement! \"Step Into Your Story\" is a fantastic theme.  Here's my high-level CMO perspective on this fleshed-out plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Overall Assessment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strengths:**  Highly engaging, leverages user-generated content effectively, aligns perfectly with our target audience's values, and creates a strong sense of community. The AR element is particularly innovative.\n",
      "*   **Potential Weaknesses:**  Requires significant coordination and resources (especially the pop-up stations and cleanup events).  Success hinges on strong execution and clear messaging.  AR development needs to be flawless.\n",
      "*   **Risk Mitigation:**  Pilot test the pop-up concept in one key market before scaling.  Thoroughly test the AR experience before launch.  Have contingency plans for weather-dependent outdoor events.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. CMO Directives (to the Marketer):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Prioritize User-Generated Content (UGC):**  Make UGC the *heart* of the campaign.  Actively seek out and amplify compelling stories.  Ensure clear guidelines for submissions and usage rights.  Allocate budget for rewarding participants.\n",
      "2.  **AR Integration is Key:** The AR experience *must* be seamless, visually appealing, and easy to use.  It's a potential differentiator, so invest in top-tier development.  Track usage meticulously to understand user behavior and optimize the experience.\n",
      "3.  **Community Cleanup Events - Think Local, Act Global:**  Partner with *existing* local environmental groups to maximize impact and reach.  Don't just clean up; educate participants about our sustainability practices.  Document the events beautifully for ongoing content.\n",
      "4.  **Influencer Selection is Paramount:**  Go beyond follower count.  Choose micro-influencers who are *genuinely* passionate about sustainability and whose personal brand aligns with ours.  Give them creative freedom to tell *their* stories authentically.\n",
      "5.  **Data-Driven Iteration:**  Don't just track the KPIs; *analyze* them in real-time.  Be prepared to adjust the campaign based on performance.  If one element isn't working, pivot quickly.\n",
      "6.  **Budget Allocation:**  Allocate the budget strategically, prioritizing the elements with the highest potential for engagement and ROI.  AR development, influencer partnerships, and UGC rewards should be top priorities.\n",
      "7.  **Legal Review:**  Ensure all contest rules, terms and conditions, and privacy policies are clearly defined and legally compliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Big Picture Focus:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Brand Building:**  This campaign is not just about selling shoes; it's about building a brand that resonates with a conscious consumer.  Every element should reinforce our commitment to sustainability, community, and personal expression.\n",
      "*   **Long-Term Engagement:**  Think beyond the initial launch.  How can we sustain the momentum and continue to engage our community over the long term?  Consider creating an ongoing \"Step Into Your Story\" platform.\n",
      "*   **Measurement Beyond Sales:**  While sales are important, also track brand awareness, customer sentiment, and the overall impact of the campaign on our brand reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Final Thought:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a bold and ambitious campaign. If executed well, it has the potential to be a game-changer for our brand.  Trust your team, empower them to be creative, and stay focused on the big picture. Let's make sure we're not just selling shoes, but inspiring a movement.\n",
